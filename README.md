# Hello there, welcome

If you're here, means you have some interest in Rust, or perhaps you're exploring.
So I decided to try out Rust because I'd love to get my hands on compilers and make some Rust open source contributions.

This repository will contain all my learnings along the way, with code samples too.

If you're looking to get your hands on Rust too, I tell you, you first goto should be the [Rust book.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

Aloha.
